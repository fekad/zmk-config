# zmk-config

future design:
- 32 key (2+3+3+3+2 + 3 thumb)
- adding angle and space for the staggers (more naturtal placement)

problems
- mo nav in raised layers as well (eg. enter and arrows in num layer
- one up and one down layer if posible
- better way to change devices
- better app switcher
- combine single tap modifiers shfit then ctrl and hold = shift + ctrl + ...
- maybe swap alt and cmd
- back and forward in browser history
